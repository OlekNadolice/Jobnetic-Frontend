## You have to read this before open my application !!!!!!

- Add Blocker is blocking some of my API Endpoints i call them /advertisement etc. I heard that many people have this problem, so if you want to have acces for all informations, you have to turn off add blocker for this site !

# Jobnetic

- I will deploy this webiste soon. There is a few things that I need to change / add.

# What I use to build this application

- HTML
- CSS with modules
- React
- Context API for managing the global state of application.
- Type Script
- Express for Backend
- Mongo DB - Cloud version for Database



# Features
- Creating account
- Logging to account
- Adding Job advertisement
- Sending job application with email

# Reflections

- The speed of the backend may not be good, the reason is that I use Heroku to host my backend, which as we all know is not very efficient.
