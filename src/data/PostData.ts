    title: "What to Do After College: Corporate Ladder Isn't the Only Path",
    Description:
      "Many students are so wrapped up in studying that career planning is close to the bottom of the to-do list. But thinking about life after graduation isn't exactly the worst thing you can do. Thankfully, there are many career options. You can go corporate, work for a small business, start your own business, or even purchase one that already exists.   Many students choose the corporate path. Large firms often pay generous salaries and come loaded with perks. Employer paid health insurance is still the cheapest form around. And remember these three words: flexible spending account. A flex account is a corporate fund that allows you to use pre-tax dollars for necessary expenses.   ",

    title: "Having a Hard Time At Work? Maybe You Are in the Wrong Job",
    Description:
      "When 'hard day at work' is mentioned in conversation, many different things come to mind. Some people think a hard job is intense physical labor, while to others, sitting at a desk crunching numbers is a living nightmare. Career analysts like to say that a hard job is one that gives you no personal satisfaction. So how can you know if it's your job you hate and not just work in general? Well, according to FastCompany.com, most of these apply to your life:    Your never excited to go to work.  You don't feel like you have the 'special' talent for the position. You only stay because you don't want to look for another.  You feel burnt out.  You hate it when people ask what you do.  For more proof you hate your job, take the scientific formula of job satisfaction created by two economists. The economists came up with four factors for job satisfaction: trust in management, variety of projects, high skill level, and enough time allowed for you to finish your work. The stronger those qualities at work, the higher satisfaction you probably have. Trust in management is the most important criterion.",

    title: "Establishing a Career Plan",
    Description:
      "When you begin thinking about your career, you may want to establish a career plan. Before you start sketching out a plan, you may want to begin by evaluating yourself. Get to know your strengths, weaknesses, preferences, aptitude and personality traits. By being aware of these personal aspects, you may be inspired to look at other career options that you have not considered before. It may also give you a better sense of what careers are best suited for you. If sitting down and thinking about yourself doesn't help, you may want to take a career assessment test at your career center.   Next, you may want to make a list of careers that best fits your interests. Put anything on the list that you may be interested in, and don't worry about meeting the qualifications yet. This exercise allows you to get an idea of what you're interested in before you begin researching the careers more thoroughly. It may also help you realize that your goals and interests have changed.  After you have a list of possible careers, you may want to pick your favorites and begin researching. Research may involve talking to people who are in that field, speaking to a career counselor, reading career guide books or surfing different websites. Researching may help you get a better understanding of the careers your interested in. When you're researching what types of tasks are involved in your career choices, you may also want to find out what companies hire people in this field. If you're able to talk to somebody from a company, you may want to find out if the company offers any mobility in your field. You may also want to consider other plans that you had in mind. Do you want to get married before you are thirty? Do you want to have kids? Would the demands of this job conflict with any of these plans?  Now that you have done the research, you may want to decide on a specific career that you want to pursue. After you decide on a career, you may want to start researching what type of a major is associated with this field and if a minor in anything would be beneficial. You may want to see if a license is required. Some careers don't require a degree, but instead they require a license. Licenses may be attained through community colleges, vocational school or an accredited occupation program. Finding out your career's requirements may help you stay on track while you're in school. Having this goal during college may also help to keep you motivated especially when things begin getting difficult.  For further information about career planning, you may want to try the Quintessential Careers website, www.quintcareers.com, because it offers a variety of career information or the College Board website, www.collegeboard.com, which organizes careers according to major.",

    title: "Have Confidence on the Job",
    Description:
      "Some qualities of a person cannot be learned, but rather are nurtured and grown. Ambition and confidence are two of these qualities. One of the main pillars of ambition is high self esteem. According to career publisher CareerJournal.com, self-acceptance and faith-in-oneself allows confidence and ambition to grow. Lacking this personal characteristic can put a serious damper on your career goals. Here is how to let your personality shine and make way for your professional life.  Low self-esteem is one of the major stumbling blocks to achieving your goals. CareerJournal.com says no personal characteristic is more important to workplace success than self-esteem. Self-esteem is the foundation for all the other characteristics you want to build. Ways to increase your self-esteem include  Stomp negative thoughts - Recognize when you are thinking negative and change attitude. Power of mind over body.  Deal with disappointment - Instead of crushing yourself over something that went afoul, focus on what you learned and how to do it better next time.  Goal Focused - A good example is overweight people trying to slim down. Instead of focusing on what is not being accomplished, think about your goal, in this case: what will life be like as a healthy person?  Be realistic about yourself. Don't set outlandish goals that are impossible. Shoot for the moon, but set a realistic path to get there so you will limit disappointment.",

    title: "First Job Out of College: How to Deal",
    Description:
      "'Culture shock' is probably the best phrase to describe the transition from college to the business world. For most people professional life is full of sharp outfits, deadlines and midday meetings. So how do you prepare for a life in the corporate world? Learn the rules of the office.  Different values are cherished within every company. A good way to bond with coworkers is to master your office courtesy. According to national workplace consulting firm MJN Consulting, the number one office un-courtesy is not returning phone calls and email. Following closely in second is using the last piece of paper in the copy machine and not refilling the tray. Simple things can leave a lasting impression. Who wears the pants in your firm? Always get to know who is running each department. Remember: job title doesn't necessarily mean influence. Often a lower level employee will have special training or some other quality that makes him or her the go-to person. Getting thrown into a foreign environment is a great way to learn what you can and can't do. According to job search firm Monster.com, you must take it upon yourself to learn where you excel and where you need to learn new training. Gone is the time when a worker is a lifelong employee the firm takes under its wings. Today's workers change careers as many times as they change apartments. Build skills to take on the road.   ",
